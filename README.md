# Ask Selma - A Simple HTML GUI for Ollama

[Ollama](https://ollama.com) is great as a free local chat solution, but sometimes you need an extremely simple interface.

The solution: **Ask Selma** consists of just a single HTML page **index.html** - that's it!

You don't need any additional libraries. The HTML server can work without internet access,  
which can be necessary in some companies for security reasons.
